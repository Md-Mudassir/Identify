# Identify - Let's Reunite (Under Development)

Identify can be used by parents to report missing children as well as citizens to report about any vulnerable child on the streets with details and pictures. The site will connect to database and use facial recognition to find a probable match, allowing him/her to see the whereabouts of the child.
